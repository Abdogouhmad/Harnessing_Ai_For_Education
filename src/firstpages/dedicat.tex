    With the guidance and blessing of ALLAH SWT, I embark on the journey of
    completing this research paper. I wholeheartedly dedicate this work to my cherished
    family---a source of unconditional love, inspiration, motivation, and support
    throughout my life. Their steady belief in my attempts has been
    a beacon of strength and hope. To my dearest family, your unshakable faith in me
    is the mainspring of my achievements. Therefore, I am eternally grateful.
