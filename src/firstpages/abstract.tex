    This research paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    to enhance learning experiences in the Humanities, focusing on English
    university students at Hassan II University in Casablanca, Morocco.
    The study investigates studentsâ€™ perceptions and experiences with
    AI-driven tools to determine if these technologies can improve
    academic engagement and performance. It also examines the
    challenges and opportunities associated with integrating AI
    in higher education in Morocco, specifically within the humanities
    department. Through a thorough analysis of data and literature,
    the findings not only demonstrate the positive impact of AI on
    learning outcomes but also emphasize the importance of embracing
    AI technologies in educational settings. This research provides
    valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and researchers
    interested in using AI to enhance learning experiences and
    promote academic success in the digital age.
