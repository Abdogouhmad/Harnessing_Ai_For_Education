    This research paper investigates the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
    to revolutionize learning experiences in the Humanities, with a specific focus 
    on English university students at Hassan II University in Casablanca, Morocco. 
    By exploring students' perceptions and experiences with AI-driven tools, 
    the study examines how these technologies can enhance academic engagement and performance. 
    Furthermore, it delves into the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing 
    AI in higher education within the Moroccan context, particularly within the humanities department. 
    Through a rigorous analysis of data and literature, the findings not only highlight the positive 
    impact of AI on learning outcomes but also underscore the importance of embracing AI technologies 
    in educational settings. This research contributes valuable insights for educators, policymakers, 
    and researchers seeking to leverage AI for enriching learning experiences and fostering academic success in the digital age.
