\section{Problem statement}\label{sec:problem-statement}
\justifying
Artificial intelligence is a revolutionary technology that can potentially transform any industry, including education, to be productive. Despite the emergence of AI and AI-driven tools like “ChatGPT,” which have significant capabilities, there remains a gap in comprehending how effectively AI can enhance learning experiences within humanities. regardless that “ChatGPT” and similar AI-driven tools have gained prominence across various industries since its release in late November 2022, they have not been fully utilized in education to promote genuine educational engagement and knowledge acquisition among humanities students. Consequently, questions have arisen about the efficacy of using these tools in higher education. Therefore, the central problem of this study is How AI can be harnessed in education to enhance learning experiences in the humanities.

\section{The Rationale and significance of the study}\label{sec:the-rationale-and-significance-of-the-study}
\justifying
The epidemic accessibility and abundance of AI show that 73\% of US companies have already
implemented Ai in some businesses, according to\textcite{pricewaterhousecoopers}.
. Hence, the fame of using AI in recent years prompted researchers to explore practical ways of utilizing AI tools for enhancing human productivity, including education. This research paper tackles AI-driven tools in a framework that deals with the problem of harnessing them effectively for enhancing learning experiences in the humanities. This study will provide a more in-depth and detailed understanding of using AI tools within humanities.

of harnessing Artificial Intelligence for
Enhanced Learning Experiences in the Humanities.
Hence,
the following research questions will be addressed in this paper:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the most effective ways to utilize AI-driven
    tools for enhancing learning experiences in higher education, 
    especially in the humanities?
    \item What is the impact of AI-driven pedagogical tools 
    on university students' academic performance 
    and engagement in the humanities?
    \item What are the challenges and opportunities associated 
    with using AI in higher education in Morocco, 
    specifically in the humanities?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Hypotheses}\label{subsec:hypotheses}
\justifying
Following intended objectives, these hypotheses have been developed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Students who use AI-driven tools reveal better learning outcomes
    compared to those who do not in higher education, specifically in the humanities.
    \item AI-driven tools are significantly improving academic
    performance and engagement in the humanities.
    \item There are challenges and opportunities are associated with using Ai in higher
    education in Morocco, specifically in the humanities.
\end{itemize}
