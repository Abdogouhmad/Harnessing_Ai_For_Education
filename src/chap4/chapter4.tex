\chapter{DISCUSSION \& ANALYSIS}
\section{Introduction}
After clarifying the data collection process and the relevant procedures
adopted for the analysis, this chapter aims to examine the previously
collected data in order to determine the definitive truth regarding
harnessing AI into higher education. To this end, statistical tables
and graphs will be disclosed. The findings of this paper are consistent
with previous research results on the practical ways of implementing AI
into humanities, students' points of view about their performance while
using AI, challenges, and opportunities. In short, the survey's results
indicate that students' academic performance is improved while using AI.
\section{Results}
The data collected from the survey conducted among English university
students revealed compelling insights into the students' perceptions
and experiences with AI-driven tools. The analysis utilized descriptive
statistical techniques to interpret the responses gathered through
the questionnaire. The questionnaire is divided into two main parts:
The first part investigates whether the student's academic performance
has improved or not while using AI-driven methods. The second part is
about the challenges and opportunities faced during using AI for academic studies.

\end{figure}

After assessing the respondents' opinions on the use of AI-driven tools and students'
academic performance, it is obvious that the majority of their academic performance is improved.
The data reported that 71.7\% agreed that AI improves their academic performance.
In addition, 21.7\% of respondents believed that the use of AI did not affect their
academic performance. Whereas 6.7\% showed negative results, believing
that AI affects their academic performance to be declined while using it.
\subsection{The students' engagements while using AI-driven tools in an academic setting}

			1.7/ Not engaged at all }
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\captionof{figure}{Perceived academic engagement using AI-driven tools}
\end{figure}

The data collected on the extent of student engagement when using AI-driven
tools provides a diverse range of perceptions and experiences.
A significant portion of respondents reported moderately engaged, 40\%,
indicating a level of engagement with these AI-driven tools, with almost equal neutrality,
30\%, suggesting a mixed reception. However, a notable subset of students
reported feeling highly engaged 21.7\%, depicting that these tools can effectively
encourage students to be engaged.
Negatively, the presence of respondents feeling not very engaged 6.7\% and 1.7\% not
engaged at all highlights potential limitations or challenges associated with the
implementation or usage of AI-driven tools.

\subsection{Challenges faced while using AI-driven tools in academic setting}

\end{figure}
The bar chart shows the results of a survey on the challenges students face when using AI-driven tools in their academic studies.
Out of 60 respondents, the biggest challenge was reported to be the resistance or skepticism from professors toward using AI-driven
tools, with 48.3\% of students selecting that option. Insufficient training is the second challenge faced by 38.8\%.
Following the lack of access to reliable internet, 28.3\% of students reported this as a challenge.
In addition, 26.7\% of students reported concern with their privacy and data security matters. At the same time,
2.3\% was bias, misinformation, propaganda in the AI tools, and high prices of the AI-driven tools.
\subsection{AI-driven tools and opportunities for improving learning experiences in the humanities }

			21.7/ No,
			28.3/ I don't know
		}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\captionof{figure}{AI and opportunities}
\end{figure}
The majority of English university students reported that 50\% of AI-driven tools offer opportunities for enhancing learning experiences in the humanities.
In addition, 28.3\% report the ignorance of the opportunities that AI-driven tools offer.
On the other hand, 21.7\% reported that AI-driven tools offer an opportunity to enhance the learning experience within the humanities setting.

Those who answered with yes a question were asked to get some examples from students
to understand what kind of opportunities AI-driven tools can offer to enhance the learning experiences,
and the answers were follow:

% 1st resp
\resp{1}{AI-driven tools in higher education could enhance personalized learning
	through adaptive learning platforms and virtual
	tutoring, and improve research with data analysis tools.}
% 2nd resp
\resp{2}{Research Assistance: AI can assist
	researchers in analyzing vast amounts of
	data, generating hypotheses, and identifying trends,
	accelerating the pace of discovery.}
% 3rd resp
\resp{3}{It can help students be more self-reliant
	and seek knowledge wherever and whenever they want to.}
%4rd resp 
\resp{4}{Making student more used to communicate with chat
	bot ai characters when they can't find native speakers to communicate with.}
%5th resp
\resp{5}{It helps you correct some mistakes and learn from them.
	It elevates your writing and information base and limit their context.}

As it is shown the majority of english students to claim that AI-driven tools can
help students to boost their productivity through analysing the data for researcheres
and provide personalized learning through adaptive learning platforms and virtual tutoring.

\section{Discussion}
It would be more fitting to restate the current study’s goals and research hypothesis
before digging deeper into the research findings and discussion. As mentioned in the
introduction, the main objective of this paper is to evaluate English students’ attitudes towards the
use of AI-driven tools for enhancing their academic prefromance and learning experiences.
learners. Accordingly, the recent study has significantly helped
to validate or reject the hypotheses stated in the previous chapter.
These later were formed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item AI-driven tools are singificantly fostering engagment in academic setting.
	\item AI-driven tools are significantly improving academic performance.
	\item There are challenges and opportunities are associated with using AI in higher education
	      in Morocco, specifically in the humanities
\end{itemize}
The current study’s findings strongly demonstrate positive attitudes by students towards
the use AI-driven tools as learning tool. The students have been asked precise questions
to explore their perceptions on the use of AI-driven tools

Firstly, the findings reveal a notable increase in student engagement 37\% when
utilizing AI technologies. The data collected from English university students
strongly supports the idea that AI can effectively enhance student engagement,
fostering a more interactive and dynamic learning environment. This aligns with
existing literature that emphasizes the role of technology in promoting active
participation among students.

Secondly, the research results demonstrate a positive correlation between the use of AI-driven tools and students' academic performance.
As data results reveal, the major part of participants 74\% believed that AI-driven tools
improved their academic performance. In the same way,
\citep{mohammed_exploring_2023} performed a related study
to demonstrate that AI-driven tools can effectively enhance
academic preformance and foster engagment. Results showed
that the majority of respondents agreed that \say{ChatGPT}
motivates and engages students by offering access to
many resources and improving academic perormance.

Furthermore, the research findings shed light on the challenges encountered by
students when utilizing AI-driven tools in educational settings. These challenges,
as reported by the participants, offer valuable insights into the practical obstacles
associated with the implementation of AI technologies in learning environments.
Issues such as technical difficulties, lack of training, resistance or skipticism of professors,
and concerns regarding data privacy and security emerge as significant
hurdles that need to be addressed to ensure the effective utilization of AI in education.


Lastly, the research results highlight the opportunities presented by AI-driven
tools for transforming learning experiences in the humanities. By exploring
students' perspectives and experiences with AI technologies, the study uncovers
the potential for personalized learning, adaptive tutoring, and data analysis to help researchers
with their vas-amount data. These opportunities align with the broader literature
on the transformative impact of AI in education, emphasizing the role of technology
in facilitating innovative and tailored learning experiences. Leveraging these
opportunities can empower educators to create engaging, effective, and personalized
learning environments that cater to the diverse needs of students in the humanities.


\section{Conclusion}
Throughout this chapter, we have conducted an ongoing study related to students’
attitudes towards the use of AI-driven tools as a learning tool to enhance the learning experiences
within academic setting. The aim was to present and discuss the findings of the study in depth.
Additionally, this study sought to validate or reject the formulated hypotheses mentioned
in the methodology chapter, and correlate the concluded findings with the paper’s literature
review and see how far it converges or diverges from it. The final chapter would discuss
the implications and the limitations of this study. Finally, it will cover an inclusive summary
of the research paper and serve as a springboard to a more in-depth analysis.
