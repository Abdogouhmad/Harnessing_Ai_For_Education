      \field{abstract}{The policy-making process is influenced by the results of a good evaluation process. However, to get valid results, the evaluation process requires supporting data and technology. Higher education produces huge amounts of data but is still lacking in turning it into useful information. With the rapid development of information technology, higher education data must be processed into information that can be used as an evaluation and basis for making quick and accurate policies. Educational Data Mining ({EDM }) is a technique used to measure students’ academic achievement to improve their results, assess the learning process, evaluate the overall quality of education, etc. Besides, the relevance of the curriculum followed by a university and the competencies possessed can be analyzed using a tracer study ({TS}). The current study uses {EDM} to extract information from higher education data and tracer study results. The relationship between higher education data and {TS} data was analyzed. The results indicated that not all students with higher {GPA} scores get jobs per the competencies they had in college, however, those with higher {GPAs} and who were actively organized during college are easier to find work. The study results must be considered as material for curriculum evaluation and for making higher education policies. Keywords: higher education, Educational Data mining development, Tracer Study, curriculum evaluation, policy making}

      \field{abstract}{Artificial intelligence ({AI}) has the potential to transform education by enabling personalized learning experiences, fostering collaboration and communication, and cultivating critical thinking and problem-solving skills. However, ethical issues such as privacy, bias, and the impact of technology on values and beliefs must be considered. This paper explores the implications of integrating {AI} into education from the perspective of Ignatian pedagogy, a Jesuit-inspired educational approach rooted in certain principles and values. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature on {AI} in education and Ignatian pedagogy, this paper investigates how {AI} can support the goals of Ignatian pedagogy while addressing ethical concerns. The paper presents examples of {AI} use in educational settings, highlighting the potential benefits and ethical challenges. Notably, there is a gap in research on how {AI} aligns with the values and goals of different educational approaches, including Ignatian pedagogy. To address this gap, this paper examines the potential of {AI} to support Ignatian pedagogy and identifies critical ethical considerations that should be addressed. Our findings suggest that {AI} has the potential to support Ignatian pedagogy, but such integration requires thoughtful consideration of ethical issues. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential of {AI} to support Ignatian pedagogy and other educational approaches while addressing ethical concerns such as privacy, bias, and the impact of technology on values and beliefs.}

      \field{abstract}{The article is devoted to the issue of the construction of an intelligent tutoring system which was created by our university for implementing distance learning and combined forms of studies. Significantly higher demand for such tools occurred during the { COVID}-19 pandemic when distance learning was used by students in their full-time studies. Current Learning Management Systems ({ LMS}) do not address students’ individuality regarding their various levels of input knowledge and skills or their different learning styles, which, in our case, are based on sensory preferences. Therefore, this article proposes a model of an intelligent tutoring system to control learning by accentuating the individual needs of a student. The foundation stones of this system are an expert system and adaptation mechanisms. The expert system acts as a tool for the identification of students’ needs from the point of view of input knowledge and sensory preferences. Sensory preferences influence the student’s learning style. The implemented adaptation mechanisms control the progress of the student through a study unit. The model was implemented in the {LMS} Moodle environment. Regarding the focus of the research content, our model is oriented on the study of the English language, where each student receives a unique study plan, which is continuously adapted based on achieved results. We consider the focus on the individuality of the student to be an innovative approach that can be achieved automatically on a mass scale.}

      \field{abstract}{Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) is often regarded as the next general-purpose technology with a rapid, penetrating, and far-reaching use over a broad number of industrial sectors. The main feature of new general-purpose technology is to enable new ways of production that may increase productivity. However, to date, only a few studies have investigated the likely productivity effects of {AI} at the firm-level, presumably due to limited data availability. We exploit unique survey data on firms’ adoption of {AI} technology and estimate its productivity effects with a sample of German firms. We employ both a cross-sectional dataset and a panel database. To address the potential endogeneity of {AI} adoption, we also implement {IV} estimators. We find positive and significant associations between the use of {AI} and firm productivity. This finding holds for different measures of {AI} usage, i.e., an indicator variable of {AI} adoption, and the intensity with which firms use {AI} methods in their business processes.}

      \field{abstract}{The use of Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) and specifically, { OpenAI}'s {ChatGPT}, has been increasing in the educational field as a tool to enhance learning and teaching processes. Understanding the potential of {ChatGPT} in the classroom is crucial for instructors and educators because it can provide significant benefits in the preparation of classes, exams, and instructional materials. Nonetheless, it is even more crucial to understand how students may use it because many will use it regardless of its adoption by the instructor.This paper analyzes the potential of {ChatGPT} in the classroom, exploring its applications as a writing assistant, study tool, personal tutor, and more. Our aim is to shed light on the present capabilities of {ChatGPT} in higher education and to provide a comprehensive view of its advantages and challenges.}

      \field{abstract}{The article analyses the theoretical foundations of using artificial intelligence ({AI}) in higher education. It shows that the {AI} system as a strategic technology provides many benefits for the lives of people and society as a whole and also symbolises a new stage not only in the history of digital technologies but also on a global scale of development of modern civilisation. The article provides an overview of the policies of European and global organisations, including the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation ({UNESCO}), the European Union, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the European University Association, etc. on the effective use of {AI} in everyday life and, in particular, in education. Based on the analysis results, the article systematises ethical principles (human-centred values, governance , transparency, accountability, sustainability, proportionality, confidentiality, safety, security, and inclusiveness) that should be applied in using {AI}. The {SWOT} analysis helped identify strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and risks of using {AI} in higher education. The article examines the regulatory framework for the implementation of {AI} in the Ukrainian educational area and identifies the peculiarities of {AI} application in the educational process of higher education institutions. It analyses statistical data for identifying the risks and threats of using {AI} in {HEIs} under the Open Science, obtained in 2023 by researchers of the Institute of Higher Education of {NAES} of Ukraine in the all-Ukrainian survey “Open Science in Higher Education Institutions of Ukraine,” more than 1.5 thousand respondents participated. The article also substantiates practical recommendations for developing and implementing {AI} in higher education at the national, institutional and individual levels.}

      \field{abstract}{Learning experience design ({LXD}), that is, the conscious design of learning experiences based on the principles and methods of the design discipline, is a term that is increasingly being used in the design of (digital) learning environments. The aim is to make learning a positive, exciting experience for the learner. This article will introduce the understanding of “learning experience design” and describe its application at Graz University of Technology ({TU} Graz). As creativity is a base for the design discipline, the organizational unit “educational technology” sees {LXD} as a chance to develop innovative, quality online teaching and learning materials. The article will show the application and results of {LXD} of several different projects and resources developed for teachers and students by the educational technology team at {TU} Graz: the student study progress dashboard, the {TELucation} website relaunch, and the development of a modifiable digital template for lecturer training.}

      \field{abstract}{Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) is having a significant impact on Latin American higher education. Through a bibliographic methodology of a qualitative nature, it has been possible to analyze and understand the scope of {AI} in this area. In the first place, it is highlighted that {AI} in Latin American higher education has allowed expanding access to education, breaking geographical and economic barriers. This is achieved through the availability of digital educational resources and the ability to participate in online learning programs. In addition, {AI} has promoted the personalization of learning, adapting the educational process to the individual needs of students. Through intelligent tutoring systems and {AI}-based educational platforms , relevant content can be offered and adapted to each student, as well as provide instant and personalized feedback. {AI} has also improved the efficiency and quality of higher education. By automating administrative and repetitive tasks, time is freed up for educators to focus on more meaningful activities, such as curriculum design and individual attention to students. In addition, {AI} enables data analysis and pedagogical reporting, facilitating evidence-based decision making. However, ethical and privacy challenges associated with the use of {AI} in higher education are recognized. It is necessary to ensure the protection of students' personal data and address issues of fairness and transparency in the development and implementation of {AI} systems. In conclusion, {AI} is transforming higher education in Latin America, providing access, personalization, efficiency and quality. The qualitative bibliographic methodology has allowed us to understand the scope of {AI} in this area, highlighting its positive impact and the challenges that must be addressed for its responsible implementation.}

      \field{abstract}{{EDM} and {LA} are two fields that study how to use facts to get more academic learning and enhance the students’ entire performance. Both areas are concerned with a broad range of issues such as curriculum strategies, coaching, mental well-being of students, learning motivation, and academic achievement. The { COVID}-19 pandemic highly disrupted the higher education sector and shifted the old, chalk-talk teaching-learning model to an online learning format. This meant that the structure and nature of teaching, learning, assessment, and feedback methodologies also changes. With the empowerment in technology, timely and effective feedback is provided by the teachers to achieve greater learning. Through these studies, it is noted that negative feedback discourages the effort and achievement of learners, so it should be carefully crafted and delivered. In this work, a new methodology is planned based on an improved {FCN} (fully connected network). The key impartial of the proposed method is to regulate the assessment of the quality of students in Higher Education {HE}. The proposed methodology is composed of different phases: The first phase is data acquisition, in which the data are gathered from various sources for training and testing of the proposed method. The second phase is data orientation, in which the information is oriented in a specific file format. After that , data are cleaned, and preprocessing methods are applied. In the fourth phase, a machine learning-based model is developed to predict student’s academic performance. The fully connected neural network is enhanced with {LA} to better assess student quality in higher education. The proposed work is evaluated with the {OULAD} database, which was gathered from the students of Open University. The proposed methodology has attained an accuracy of 84\%, more significant than the conventional {ANN} model accuracy rate. The proposed methodology’s Recall, F1-score, and precision rates are 0.88, 0.91, and 0.93, respectively.}

      \field{abstract}{Abstract Higher education institutions face many challenges in order to increase their visibility, recognition and position in the field based or general higher education market. National or international rankings put a lot of pressure on academic leadership to fulfill the criteria of their methodologies. Learning experience is becoming a more and more important dimension of the motivation to study. In the contemporary context of networking diversity, the process of generating learning experience is becoming part of the institutional efforts related to which creating an internal environment is connected to the learning experience generating. The literature review proves a higher interest on student engagement, on students’ and graduates’ involvement in the institutional life, on development a long-term relationship between university and graduates on one hand and between university and industry on the other hand etc. The common issue among all these subjects is the learning experience that is provided to students through all the activities in higher education institutions. What can be done or develop in order to generate a great learning experience starts from a correct, but flexible understanding of the concept. What can be institutionally changed for the benefit of a higher learning experience need a clear recognition of what more experienced institutions have already achieved. The objectives of the paper include: a) a clear understanding of the learning experience concept; b) an overview of the current characteristics of the learning experience providers; c) a start-up strategy for generating learning experience. All these objectives are integrated in a literature review approach as well as in a qualitative study dedicated to the perceptions of students and academics on what learning experience means and what institutionally can be improved. The findings reveal a possible model for building up a learning experience strategy for Romanian higher education institutions.}

      \field{abstract}{To assess and manage the quality of education it is important to understand what happens to students at university, what experience they gain, and whether this experience contributes to their success and development. In foreign science student experience is considered as a student-centered idea of improving the quality of higher education and a prerequisite for many initiatives in this area. However, the approaches to its study require major revision. This article presents the study which allows the students’ educational experience to be conceptualized. To diagnose and analyze the students’ educational experience a valid and reliable tool has been created. Educational experience is defined as students’ representations which are significant from the standpoint of academic success, students’ readiness for self-education and self-development, and subjective well-being. These students’ representations are the representations of the following: their educational and professional activities, themselves as the subjects of their educational and professional activities, learning and social context. The students’ educational experience is presented in the aggregate of five components: satisfaction, intention to expand experience, self-efficacy and support, self-regulated learning experience, and engagement. The analysis of the holistic experience and its components allows not only to assess the student’s subjective perception of learning, but also to predict the effectiveness of the educational process based on understanding of the key internal factors of academic performance, subjective well-being and development. The article presents a questionnaire of students' educational experience, verified on a sample of students (N=479). It meets the psychometric requirements of internal consistency, retest reliability, content, construct and criterion validity. This questionnaire can be used to control the quality of education, to do scientific research and evidence-based pedagogical experimentation in the context of the restructuring higher education.}

      \field{abstract}{This study investigated Arab postgraduate students’ uses of { ChatGPT} in their higher studies in India with a special reference to academic writing being a requirement of academic research activities. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 40 Arab postgraduates attending five universities in Kerala. Findings show that the participants perceived benefits of { ChatGPT} and effects on their academic writing, language competency, and achievement. It significantly impacts their productivity. However, not all Arab students utilize all the benefits of the tool for some reasons including lack of familiarity with the incipient {ChatGPT}. Based on the findings, the study provides some important recommendation for utilizing this chatbot in a way that increase their abilities in using technology in their studies to save time and efforts as well as familiarize them with sensitive issues of honesty and plagiarism. The study may be useful to some other participants engaged with academic writing in India and abroad.}

      \field{abstract}{Quality education, one of the seventeen sustainable development goals ({SDGs}) identified by the United Nations General Assembly, stands to benefit enormously from the adoption of artificial intelligence ({AI}) driven tools and technologies. The concurrent boom of necessary infrastructure, digitized data and general social awareness has propelled massive research and development efforts in the artificial intelligence for education ({AIEd}) sector. In this review article, we investigate how artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning methods are being utilized to support students, educators and administrative staff. We do this through the lens of a novel categorization approach. We consider the involvement of {AI}-driven methods in the education process in its entirety - from students admissions, course scheduling etc. in the proactive planning phase to knowledge delivery, performance assessment etc. in the reactive execution phase. We outline and analyze the major research directions under proactive and reactive engagement of {AI} in education using a representative group of 194 original research articles published in the past two decades i.e., 2003 - 2022. We discuss the paradigm shifts in the solution approaches proposed, i.e., in the choice of data and algorithms used over this time. We further dive into how the {COVID}-19 pandemic challenged and reshaped the education landscape at the fag end of this time period. Finally, we pinpoint existing limitations in adopting artificial intelligence for education and reflect on the path forward.}

      \field{abstract}{This research examines the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence ({AI}) in the context of higher education, using { ChatGPT} as an example. The hype around {AI} tools in education has led to a skeptical attitude among many educators towards this technology. Based on a comprehensive literature analysis, the opportunities and risks of {ChatGPT} in higher education are identified and analyzed. The research concludes with a recommendation for a sensible use of {ChatGPT} in higher education. The results of this study can support educators in their decision-making process on whether and how to use {ChatGPT} as a tool in their teaching contexts.}

      \field{abstract}{Abstract An Artificial Intelligence algorithm trained on data that reflect racial biases may yield racially biased outputs, even if the algorithm on its own is unbiased. For example, algorithms used to schedule medical appointments in the {USA} predict that Black patients are at a higher risk of no-show than non-Black patients, though technically accurate given existing data that prediction results in Black patients being overwhelmingly scheduled in appointment slots that cause longer wait times than non-Black patients. This perpetuates racial inequity, in this case lesser access to medical care. This gives rise to one type of Accuracy-Fairness trade-off: preserve the efficiency offered by using {AI} to schedule appointments or discard that efficiency in order to avoid perpetuating ethno-racial disparities. Similar trade-offs arise in a range of {AI} applications including others in medicine, as well as in education, judicial systems, and public security, among others. This article presents a framework for addressing such trade-offs where Machine Learning and Optimization components of the algorithm are decoupled. Applied to medical appointment scheduling, our framework articulates four approaches intervening in different ways on different components of the algorithm. Each yields specific results, in one case preserving accuracy comparable to the current state-of-the-art while eliminating the disparity.}

      \field{abstract}{International students face unique challenges in pursuing higher education in a foreign country. To address these challenges and enhance their academic experience, higher education institutions are increasingly exploring the use of artificial intelligence ({ AI}) applications. This research essay aims to investigate the impact of {AI} on the education of international students. Instead of a traditional literature review, it employs a research approach to examine the potential applications of {AI} and discuss associated concerns. The research paper explores various {AI} applications, such as personalized learning experiences, adaptive testing, predictive analytics, and chatbots for learning and research. By analyzing the role of {AI} in education for international students, this research paper sheds light on how { AI} can improve learning efficiency and provide customized educational support. Additionally, it identifies significant risks and limitations, including privacy concerns, cultural differences, language proficiency, and ethical implications, which must be effectively addressed. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the potential impact of {AI} on international students’ educational experiences and offer insights into the integration of {AI} into educational administration and learning processes.}

      \field{abstract}{Students of color, particularly women of color, face substantial barriers in {STEM} disciplines in higher education due to social isolation and interpersonal, technological, and institutional biases. For example, online exam proctoring software often uses facial detection technology to identify potential cheating behaviors. Undetected faces often result in flagging and notifying instructors of these as “suspicious” instances needing manual review. However, facial detection algorithms employed by exam proctoring software may be biased against students with certain skin tones or genders depending on the images employed by each company as training sets. This phenomenon has not yet been quantified nor is it readily accessible from the companies that make this type of software. To determine if the automated proctoring software adopted at our institution and which is used by at least 1,500 universities nationally, suffered from a racial , skin tone, or gender bias, the instructor outputs from ∼357 students from four courses were examined. Student data from one exam in each course was collected, a high-resolution photograph was used to manually categorize skin tone, and the self-reported race and sex for each student was obtained. The likelihood that any groups of students were flagged more frequently for potential cheating was examined. The results of this study showed a significant increase in likelihood that students with darker skin tones and Black students would be marked as more in need of instructor review due to potential cheating. Interestingly, there were no significant differences between male and female students when considered in aggregate but, when examined for intersectional differences, women with the darkest skin tones were far more likely than darker skin males or lighter skin males and females to be flagged for review. Together, these results suggest that a major automated proctoring software may employ biased {AI} algorithms that unfairly disadvantage students. This study is novel as it is the first to quantitatively examine biases in facial detection software at the intersection of race and sex and it has potential impacts in many areas of education, social justice, education equity and diversity, and psychology.}

      \field{abstract}{The policy-making process is influenced by the results of a good evaluation process. However, to get valid results, the evaluation process requires supporting data and technology. Higher education produces huge amounts of data but is still lacking in turning it into useful information. With the rapid development of information technology, higher education data must be processed into information that can be used as an evaluation and basis for making quick and accurate policies. Educational Data Mining ({EDM }) is a technique used to measure students’ academic achievement to improve their results, assess the learning process, evaluate the overall quality of education, etc. Besides, the relevance of the curriculum followed by a university and the competencies possessed can be analyzed using a tracer study ({TS}). The current study uses {EDM} to extract information from higher education data and tracer study results. The relationship between higher education data and {TS} data was analyzed. The results indicated that not all students with higher {GPA} scores get jobs per the competencies they had in college, however, those with higher {GPAs} and who were actively organized during college are easier to find work. The study results must be considered as material for curriculum evaluation and for making higher education policies.

      \field{abstract}{Artificial intelligence ({AI}) has the potential to transform education by enabling personalized learning experiences, fostering collaboration and communication, and cultivating critical thinking and problem-solving skills. However, ethical issues such as privacy, bias, and the impact of technology on values and beliefs must be considered. This paper explores the implications of integrating {AI} into education from the perspective of Ignatian pedagogy, a Jesuit-inspired educational approach rooted in certain principles and values. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature on {AI} in education and Ignatian pedagogy, this paper investigates how {AI} can support the goals of Ignatian pedagogy while addressing ethical concerns. The paper presents examples of {AI} use in educational settings, highlighting the potential benefits and ethical challenges. Notably, there is a gap in research on how {AI} aligns with the values and goals of different educational approaches, including Ignatian pedagogy. To address this gap, this paper examines the potential of {AI} to support Ignatian pedagogy and identifies critical ethical considerations that should be addressed. Our findings suggest that {AI} has the potential to support Ignatian pedagogy, but such integration requires thoughtful consideration of ethical issues. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential of {AI} to support Ignatian pedagogy and other educational approaches while addressing ethical concerns such as privacy, bias, and the impact of technology on values and beliefs.}

      \field{abstract}{The article is devoted to the issue of the construction of an intelligent tutoring system which was created by our university for implementing distance learning and combined forms of studies. Significantly higher demand for such tools occurred during the { COVID}-19 pandemic when distance learning was used by students in their full-time studies. Current Learning Management Systems ({ LMS}) do not address students’ individuality regarding their various levels of input knowledge and skills or their different learning styles, which, in our case, are based on sensory preferences. Therefore, this article proposes a model of an intelligent tutoring system to control learning by accentuating the individual needs of a student. The foundation stones of this system are an expert system and adaptation mechanisms. The expert system acts as a tool for the identification of students’ needs from the point of view of input knowledge and sensory preferences. Sensory preferences influence the student’s learning style. The implemented adaptation mechanisms control the progress of the student through a study unit. The model was implemented in the {LMS} Moodle environment. Regarding the focus of the research content, our model is oriented on the study of the English language, where each student receives a unique study plan, which is continuously adapted based on achieved results. We consider the focus on the individuality of the student to be an innovative approach that can be achieved automatically on a mass scale.}

      \field{abstract}{Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) is often regarded as the next general-purpose technology with a rapid, penetrating, and far-reaching use over a broad number of industrial sectors. The main feature of new general-purpose technology is to enable new ways of production that may increase productivity. However, to date, only a few studies have investigated the likely productivity effects of {AI} at the firm-level, presumably due to limited data availability. We exploit unique survey data on firms’ adoption of {AI} technology and estimate its productivity effects with a sample of German firms. We employ both a cross-sectional dataset and a panel database. To address the potential endogeneity of {AI} adoption, we also implement {IV} estimators. We find positive and significant associations between the use of {AI} and firm productivity. This finding holds for different measures of {AI} usage, i.e., an indicator variable of {AI} adoption, and the intensity with which firms use {AI} methods in their business processes.}

      \field{abstract}{The article analyses the theoretical foundations of using artificial intelligence ({AI}) in higher education. It shows that the {AI} system as a strategic technology provides many benefits for the lives of people and society as a whole and also symbolises a new stage not only in the history of digital technologies but also on a global scale of development of modern civilisation. The article provides an overview of the policies of European and global organisations, including the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation ({UNESCO}), the European Union, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the European University Association, etc. on the effective use of {AI} in everyday life and, in particular, in education. Based on the analysis results, the article systematises ethical principles (human-centred values, governance , transparency, accountability, sustainability, proportionality, confidentiality, safety, security, and inclusiveness) that should be applied in using {AI}. The {SWOT} analysis helped identify strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and risks of using {AI} in higher education. The article examines the regulatory framework for the implementation of {AI} in the Ukrainian educational area and identifies the peculiarities of {AI} application in the educational process of higher education institutions. It analyses statistical data for identifying the risks and threats of using {AI} in {HEIs} under the Open Science, obtained in 2023 by researchers of the Institute of Higher Education of {NAES} of Ukraine in the all-Ukrainian survey “Open Science in Higher Education Institutions of Ukraine,” more than 1.5 thousand respondents participated. The article also substantiates practical recommendations for developing and implementing {AI} in higher education at the national, institutional and individual levels.}

      \field{abstract}{Learning experience design ({LXD}), that is, the conscious design of learning experiences based on the principles and methods of the design discipline, is a term that is increasingly being used in the design of (digital) learning environments. The aim is to make learning a positive, exciting experience for the learner. This article will introduce the understanding of “learning experience design” and describe its application at Graz University of Technology ({TU} Graz). As creativity is a base for the design discipline, the organizational unit “educational technology” sees {LXD} as a chance to develop innovative, quality online teaching and learning materials. The article will show the application and results of {LXD} of several different projects and resources developed for teachers and students by the educational technology team at {TU} Graz: the student study progress dashboard, the {TELucation} website relaunch, and the development of a modifiable digital template for lecturer training.}

      \field{abstract}{Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) is having a significant impact on Latin American higher education. Through a bibliographic methodology of a qualitative nature, it has been possible to analyze and understand the scope of {AI} in this area. In the first place, it is highlighted that {AI} in Latin American higher education has allowed expanding access to education, breaking geographical and economic barriers. This is achieved through the availability of digital educational resources and the ability to participate in online learning programs. In addition, {AI} has promoted the personalization of learning, adapting the educational process to the individual needs of students. Through intelligent tutoring systems and {AI}-based educational platforms , relevant content can be offered and adapted to each student, as well as provide instant and personalized feedback. {AI} has also improved the efficiency and quality of higher education. By automating administrative and repetitive tasks, time is freed up for educators to focus on more meaningful activities, such as curriculum design and individual attention to students. In addition, {AI} enables data analysis and pedagogical reporting, facilitating evidence-based decision making. However, ethical and privacy challenges associated with the use of {AI} in higher education are recognized. It is necessary to ensure the protection of students' personal data and address issues of fairness and transparency in the development and implementation of {AI} systems. In conclusion, {AI} is transforming higher education in Latin America, providing access, personalization, efficiency and quality. The qualitative bibliographic methodology has allowed us to understand the scope of {AI} in this area, highlighting its positive impact and the challenges that must be addressed for its responsible implementation.}

      \field{abstract}{{EDM} and {LA} are two fields that study how to use facts to get more academic learning and enhance the students’ entire performance. Both areas are concerned with a broad range of issues such as curriculum strategies, coaching, mental well-being of students, learning motivation, and academic achievement. The { COVID}-19 pandemic highly disrupted the higher education sector and shifted the old, chalk-talk teaching-learning model to an online learning format. This meant that the structure and nature of teaching, learning, assessment, and feedback methodologies also changes. With the empowerment in technology, timely and effective feedback is provided by the teachers to achieve greater learning. Through these studies, it is noted that negative feedback discourages the effort and achievement of learners, so it should be carefully crafted and delivered. In this work, a new methodology is planned based on an improved {FCN} (fully connected network). The key impartial of the proposed method is to regulate the assessment of the quality of students in Higher Education {HE}. The proposed methodology is composed of different phases: The first phase is data acquisition, in which the data are gathered from various sources for training and testing of the proposed method. The second phase is data orientation, in which the information is oriented in a specific file format. After that , data are cleaned, and preprocessing methods are applied. In the fourth phase, a machine learning-based model is developed to predict student’s academic performance. The fully connected neural network is enhanced with {LA} to better assess student quality in higher education. The proposed work is evaluated with the {OULAD} database, which was gathered from the students of Open University. The proposed methodology has attained an accuracy of 84\%, more significant than the conventional {ANN} model accuracy rate. The proposed methodology’s Recall, F1-score, and precision rates are 0.88, 0.91, and 0.93, respectively.}

      \field{abstract}{Abstract Higher education institutions face many challenges in order to increase their visibility, recognition and position in the field based or general higher education market. National or international rankings put a lot of pressure on academic leadership to fulfill the criteria of their methodologies. Learning experience is becoming a more and more important dimension of the motivation to study. In the contemporary context of networking diversity, the process of generating learning experience is becoming part of the institutional efforts related to which creating an internal environment is connected to the learning experience generating. The literature review proves a higher interest on student engagement, on students’ and graduates’ involvement in the institutional life, on development a long-term relationship between university and graduates on one hand and between university and industry on the other hand etc. The common issue among all these subjects is the learning experience that is provided to students through all the activities in higher education institutions. What can be done or develop in order to generate a great learning experience starts from a correct, but flexible understanding of the concept. What can be institutionally changed for the benefit of a higher learning experience need a clear recognition of what more experienced institutions have already achieved. The objectives of the paper include: a) a clear understanding of the learning experience concept; b) an overview of the current characteristics of the learning experience providers; c) a start-up strategy for generating learning experience. All these objectives are integrated in a literature review approach as well as in a qualitative study dedicated to the perceptions of students and academics on what learning experience means and what institutionally can be improved. The findings reveal a possible model for building up a learning experience strategy for Romanian higher education institutions.}

      \field{abstract}{To assess and manage the quality of education it is important to understand what happens to students at university, what experience they gain, and whether this experience contributes to their success and development. In foreign science student experience is considered as a student-centered idea of improving the quality of higher education and a prerequisite for many initiatives in this area. However, the approaches to its study require major revision. This article presents the study which allows the students’ educational experience to be conceptualized. To diagnose and analyze the students’ educational experience a valid and reliable tool has been created. Educational experience is defined as students’ representations which are significant from the standpoint of academic success, students’ readiness for self-education and self-development, and subjective well-being. These students’ representations are the representations of the following: their educational and professional activities, themselves as the subjects of their educational and professional activities, learning and social context. The students’ educational experience is presented in the aggregate of five components: satisfaction, intention to expand experience, self-efficacy and support, self-regulated learning experience, and engagement. The analysis of the holistic experience and its components allows not only to assess the student’s subjective perception of learning, but also to predict the effectiveness of the educational process based on understanding of the key internal factors of academic performance, subjective well-being and development. The article presents a questionnaire of students' educational experience, verified on a sample of students (N=479). It meets the psychometric requirements of internal consistency, retest reliability, content, construct and criterion validity. This questionnaire can be used to control the quality of education, to do scientific research and evidence-based pedagogical experimentation in the context of the restructuring higher education.}

      \field{abstract}{This study investigated Arab postgraduate students’ uses of { ChatGPT} in their higher studies in India with a special reference to academic writing being a requirement of academic research activities. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 40 Arab postgraduates attending five universities in Kerala. Findings show that the participants perceived benefits of { ChatGPT} and effects on their academic writing, language competency, and achievement. It significantly impacts their productivity. However, not all Arab students utilize all the benefits of the tool for some reasons including lack of familiarity with the incipient {ChatGPT}. Based on the findings, the study provides some important recommendation for utilizing this chatbot in a way that increase their abilities in using technology in their studies to save time and efforts as well as familiarize them with sensitive issues of honesty and plagiarism. The study may be useful to some other participants engaged with academic writing in India and abroad.}

      \field{abstract}{Quality education, one of the seventeen sustainable development goals ({SDGs}) identified by the United Nations General Assembly, stands to benefit enormously from the adoption of artificial intelligence ({AI}) driven tools and technologies. The concurrent boom of necessary infrastructure, digitized data and general social awareness has propelled massive research and development efforts in the artificial intelligence for education ({AIEd}) sector. In this review article, we investigate how artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning methods are being utilized to support students, educators and administrative staff. We do this through the lens of a novel categorization approach. We consider the involvement of {AI}-driven methods in the education process in its entirety - from students admissions, course scheduling etc. in the proactive planning phase to knowledge delivery, performance assessment etc. in the reactive execution phase. We outline and analyze the major research directions under proactive and reactive engagement of {AI} in education using a representative group of 194 original research articles published in the past two decades i.e., 2003 - 2022. We discuss the paradigm shifts in the solution approaches proposed, i.e., in the choice of data and algorithms used over this time. We further dive into how the {COVID}-19 pandemic challenged and reshaped the education landscape at the fag end of this time period. Finally, we pinpoint existing limitations in adopting artificial intelligence for education and reflect on the path forward.}

      \field{abstract}{This research examines the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence ({AI}) in the context of higher education, using { ChatGPT} as an example. The hype around {AI} tools in education has led to a skeptical attitude among many educators towards this technology. Based on a comprehensive literature analysis, the opportunities and risks of {ChatGPT} in higher education are identified and analyzed. The research concludes with a recommendation for a sensible use of {ChatGPT} in higher education. The results of this study can support educators in their decision-making process on whether and how to use {ChatGPT} as a tool in their teaching contexts.}

      \field{abstract}{Abstract An Artificial Intelligence algorithm trained on data that reflect racial biases may yield racially biased outputs, even if the algorithm on its own is unbiased. For example, algorithms used to schedule medical appointments in the {USA} predict that Black patients are at a higher risk of no-show than non-Black patients, though technically accurate given existing data that prediction results in Black patients being overwhelmingly scheduled in appointment slots that cause longer wait times than non-Black patients. This perpetuates racial inequity, in this case lesser access to medical care. This gives rise to one type of Accuracy-Fairness trade-off: preserve the efficiency offered by using {AI} to schedule appointments or discard that efficiency in order to avoid perpetuating ethno-racial disparities. Similar trade-offs arise in a range of {AI} applications including others in medicine, as well as in education, judicial systems, and public security, among others. This article presents a framework for addressing such trade-offs where Machine Learning and Optimization components of the algorithm are decoupled. Applied to medical appointment scheduling, our framework articulates four approaches intervening in different ways on different components of the algorithm. Each yields specific results, in one case preserving accuracy comparable to the current state-of-the-art while eliminating the disparity.}

      \field{abstract}{International students face unique challenges in pursuing higher education in a foreign country. To address these challenges and enhance their academic experience, higher education institutions are increasingly exploring the use of artificial intelligence ({ AI}) applications. This research essay aims to investigate the impact of {AI} on the education of international students. Instead of a traditional literature review, it employs a research approach to examine the potential applications of {AI} and discuss associated concerns. The research paper explores various {AI} applications, such as personalized learning experiences, adaptive testing, predictive analytics, and chatbots for learning and research. By analyzing the role of {AI} in education for international students, this research paper sheds light on how { AI} can improve learning efficiency and provide customized educational support. Additionally, it identifies significant risks and limitations, including privacy concerns, cultural differences, language proficiency, and ethical implications, which must be effectively addressed. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the potential impact of {AI} on international students’ educational experiences and offer insights into the integration of {AI} into educational administration and learning processes.}

      \field{abstract}{Students of color, particularly women of color, face substantial barriers in {STEM} disciplines in higher education due to social isolation and interpersonal, technological, and institutional biases. For example, online exam proctoring software often uses facial detection technology to identify potential cheating behaviors. Undetected faces often result in flagging and notifying instructors of these as “suspicious” instances needing manual review. However, facial detection algorithms employed by exam proctoring software may be biased against students with certain skin tones or genders depending on the images employed by each company as training sets. This phenomenon has not yet been quantified nor is it readily accessible from the companies that make this type of software. To determine if the automated proctoring software adopted at our institution and which is used by at least 1,500 universities nationally, suffered from a racial , skin tone, or gender bias, the instructor outputs from ∼357 students from four courses were examined. Student data from one exam in each course was collected, a high-resolution photograph was used to manually categorize skin tone, and the self-reported race and sex for each student was obtained. The likelihood that any groups of students were flagged more frequently for potential cheating was examined. The results of this study showed a significant increase in likelihood that students with darker skin tones and Black students would be marked as more in need of instructor review due to potential cheating. Interestingly, there were no significant differences between male and female students when considered in aggregate but, when examined for intersectional differences, women with the darkest skin tones were far more likely than darker skin males or lighter skin males and females to be flagged for review. Together, these results suggest that a major automated proctoring software may employ biased {AI} algorithms that unfairly disadvantage students. This study is novel as it is the first to quantitatively examine biases in facial detection software at the intersection of race and sex and it has potential impacts in many areas of education, social justice, education equity and diversity, and psychology.}
