\section{The use of AI in Higher Education }\label{use-ai}
\justifying
Artificial intelligence has been increasingly integrated into various aspacts of higher
education, transforming traditional eduction \citep{wang_exploring_2023}. This section explores
some ways that AI can be used to enhance learning experiences and increas the academic studens' performance
by focusing on  personalized learning, intelligent tutoring, and administrative tasks automation.

\subsection{Personalized Learning}
The use of AI technologies in higher education for personalized learning has been shown to enhance academic 
performance and engagement by providing tailored learning experiences for students. Through algorithms and data analysis, 
AI can identify patterns in student performance and preferences, enabling personalized content and activity recommendations. 
This, in turn, improves the student’s learning experience, motivation, and engagement. Additionally, AI can provide tailored 
resources based on specific needs and learning styles and track real-time progress, 
identifying areas requiring more support and adjusting the learning materials accordingly 
\citep{guerrero-quinonez_artificial_2023} and \citep{l_d_of_cs_akshara_first_grade_college_2023}.

\subsubsection{Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) as module of Perosnalized learning}

Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) offer a promising approach to enhance online learning with the help of AI. 
ITS provides personalized support, instant feedback, and continuous monitoring for more effective and autonomous learning. 
It uses AI algorithms to analyze students' data, enabling personalized experiences. These systems adapt to each student's needs, 
offering relevant content and personalized feedback. According to \citep{l_d_of_cs_akshara_first_grade_college_2023}, these systems improve adaptiveness and leverage 
personalized learning by considering the individual needs of each student. \citep{bradac_design_2022} also support this approach 
of leveraging personalized learning to enhance students' learning experience.

\subsection{ChatBots ``ChatGPT'' as a module}

In the field of higher education, ChatGPT \footnote{Chatgpt is not only the Ai-driven tools that are in market yet some 
of them are based on their API
} has proven its value as a sophisticated AI-driven tool powered by OpenAI. 
Based on the students' learning history, it offers personalized recommendations. In addition, ChatGPT can provide 
accurate answers to questions with minimal input. This assists students to improve their study skills and time 
management and increases motivation and engagement with learning by providing access to a wide range of resources. It can
be used to assess students' writing \citep{mohammed_exploring_2023}. 
ChatGPT can effectively shape teaching by allowing educators to make the right decisions, 
offering personalized assitance and support outside of regular class hours. It also prompts engagement and active 
learning through interactive and dynamic learning experiences. It can facilitate discussion, stimulate critical thinking, 
and provide immediate feedback, contributing to a better learning experience \citep{schonberger_chatgpt_2023}. 
ChatGPT has the potential to enhance learning and teaching processes, providing benefits in class 
preparation, exam preparation, and as a personal tutor \citep{domenech_chatgpt_2023}.

\subsection{AI and Administrative Efficiency: Streamlining Operations}
AI can be effectively be used to streamline the administrative tasks and automating them, allowing educators
to focus more on important activities such as curriculum design \citep{drach_use_2023}. It can streamline enrollment
and improve retention, providing institutional possibilities for better 
resource management and successful online training processes \citep{lukianets_promises_2023}. Additionally, AI enables data analysis and 
pedagogical reporting, facilitating evidance-based decision-making \citep{guerrero-quinonez_artificial_2023}.

\subsubsection{Educational Data Mining (EDM) as a module}
EDM is a technique used to extract the knowledge from data and improve academic performance, learning quality, and decision-making. 
It involves the use of statistical analysis, machine learning, and data mining to analyze academic, socioeconomic, 
and learning analytics data \citep{hooda_integrating_2022, arifin_using_2022}. EDM has shown promising results in predicting students' 
performance, with techniques like J48 \footnote{J48 is a decision tree algorithm that is commonly used in 
educational data mining (EDM) for classification tasks.} and K-means \footnote{ K-means is a clustering algorithm that is often used in educational data mining 
(EDM) for grouping similar data points together.  
It is an unsupervised learning algorithm that aims to partition the data into K clusters, where K is a predefined number. 
The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updates the centroids until convergence. 
K-means is widely used in EDM for analyzing student behaviors and identifying patterns in educational data.} being effective \citep{prince_sattam_bin_abdulaziz_university_state_2016}. 
The use of Data Mining methods in education, specifically EDM, has the potential to enhance the overall efficiency and success of educational institutions.

\section{Challenges of AI in higher education}
The emergence of AI and its growing utilization in educational contexts have 
brought to light a myriad of challenges that accompany its implementation.
This section explors the obstacles and issues encountered when integrating AI into
higher education settings.

\subsection{AI bias}
Questions has been raisen regarding the detrimental effects of AI on students if used in admission or grading processes.
Shanklin  argues that AI algorithms even if it is design to be objective and neutural, still be able to produce recially baised 
output if trained on data that reflect racial biases. in the context of medical appoitment scheduling in the United States, 
their research found that algorithms predict that black patients are more likely to miss appointments than non-black patients. 
Although technically accurate based on available data, black patients are disproportionately scheduled in
appointment slots with longer wait times, perpetuating racial inequalities and creating a lack of
access to healthcare. This raises essential accuracy- fairness trade-offs, as policymakers and stakeholders
must decide whether to prioritise efficiency or equity when using AI in these settings. It is not unique to medical appointment scheduling, but
extends to other domains such as education, judicial systems, and public safety \citep{shanklin_ethical_2022}. In addition to that 
Yolder Himes suggests that studenst of differenet skin color, face barriers in
science, technology, engineering and mathematics(STEM) fields due to baises in online exam.
The facial detection algorithms used by the software may be biased against students based on skin tones or gender.
The study showed that students with darker skin tones and black students were more likely to be marked for review, 
and women with the darkest skin tones were selected for review more often compared to the white men. Hence, 
automated proctoring software may use biased AI algorithms, 
which has implications for education, social justice, equity, and diversity \citep{yoder-himes_racial_2022}. 

\subsection{Data privacy}
