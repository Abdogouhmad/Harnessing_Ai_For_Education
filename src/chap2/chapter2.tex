\section{Defining Key Concepts}\label{sec:defining-key-concepts}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}\label{AI} refers to the ability of a computer system to perform human
	tasks that can be accomplished by human Intelligence\citep{sadiku_ai_2021}.
%	2nd diff
	\item \textbf{AI-driven tools in education} encompass the application of AI tools like \say{ChatGPT} to assist 
	students, educators and administration in an education process.
	These AI-driven tools are used for planning and reactive execution of educational phases, such as
	student admission, lesson planning, knowledge delivery and performance evaluation\citep{mallik_proactive_2023}.
	Additionally, it serves as an extension of human intelligence, enabling
	increased productivity in the educational sphere by performing tasks
	such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making\citep{cheng_widespread_2023}.

	\item \textbf{Learning experience in higher education}  refers to designing and implementing educational activities to create 
	positive and foster engaging student learning experiences \citep{kang_supporting_2023}.
	it involves comprehending and assessing the students’ educational experience, including 
	their satisfaction, self-efficacy, engagement, and self-regulated learning experience\citep{lyz_students_2022}.
	The focus is on improving the quality of education by enhancing students’ academic success, 
	readiness for self-education and self-development, and subject well-being \citep{iordache-platis_building_2018}.
