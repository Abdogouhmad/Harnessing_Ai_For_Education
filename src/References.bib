	abstract = {The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
	            created significant opportunities and challenges across various
	            sectors, and higher education is no exception. This research
	            paper delves into the multifaceted role of AI in higher education
	            and explores its potential to transform teaching, learning, and
	            administrative processes. By examining the current state of AI
	            integration in educational settings, this paper aims to shed
	            light on the benefits, challenges, and ethical considerations
	            associated with AI adoption in higher education. The key areas
	            identified where AI can make a profound impact in education are
	            in enhancing student engagement, data collection and analysis for

	            tutoring systems and virtual assistants can provide personalized
	            guidance and support to students, adapting to their individual
	            needs and learning styles. This individualization of learning
	            experiences has the potential to improve academic outcomes and
	            foster a deeper understanding of complex subjects. Furthermore,
	            AI-powered analytics and learning management systems can collect
	            and analyze vast amounts of data on student performance, enabling
	            educators to gain valuable insights into student progress and
	            identify areas that require intervention. This data-driven
	            approach can facilitate early intervention strategies and help
	            students stay on track, reducing the likelihood of dropouts and
	            improving overall retention rates. AI technologies also offer the
	            potential to streamline administrative processes within higher
	            education institutions. Automated systems can handle routine
	            administrative tasks, such as registration, scheduling, and
	            grading, freeing up valuable time for faculty and staff to focus
	            on more meaningful and strategic activities. Additionally,
	            AI-powered chatbots can provide timely and accurate responses to
	            student inquiries, improving the overall student experience and
	            reducing administrative burdens. However, alongside these
	            benefits, the integration of AI in higher education poses several
	            challenges and ethical considerations. Privacy concerns,
	            algorithmic biases, and the potential replacement of human
	            interaction are among the critical issues that need careful
	            attention. It is crucial to ensure transparency, accountability,
	            and fairness in the development and deployment of AI systems to
	            mitigate these challenges and uphold ethical standards. Through
	            an extensive review of relevant literature, case studies, and
	            expert opinions, this research paper provides a comprehensive
	            analysis of the current landscape of AI in higher education. It
	            offers recommendations for effective implementation strategies,
	            emphasizing the need for collaborative partnerships between
	            educators, administrators, and technology developers. By
	            embracing AI technologies in a thoughtful and ethical manner,
	            higher education institutions can harness the full potential of
	            AI to enhance teaching and learning outcomes, improve

	            experience they gain, and whether this experience contributes to
	            their success and development. In foreign science student
	            experience is considered as a student-centered idea of improving
	            the quality of higher education and a prerequisite for many
	            initiatives in this area. However, the approaches to its study
	            require major revision. This article presents the study which
	            allows the students’ educational experience to be conceptualized.
	            To diagnose and analyze the students’ educational experience a
	            valid and reliable tool has been created. Educational experience
	            is defined as students’ representations which are significant
	            from the standpoint of academic success, students’ readiness for
	            self-education and self-development, and subjective well-being.
	            These students’ representations are the representations of the
	            following: their educational and professional activities,
	            themselves as the subjects of their educational and professional
	            activities, learning and social context. The students’
	            educational experience is presented in the aggregate of five
	            components: satisfaction, intention to expand experience,
	            self-efficacy and support, self-regulated learning experience,
	            and engagement. The analysis of the holistic experience and its
	            components allows not only to assess the student’s subjective
	            perception of learning, but also to predict the effectiveness of
	            the educational process based on understanding of the key
	            internal factors of academic performance, subjective well-being
	            and development. The article presents a questionnaire of
	            students' educational experience, verified on a sample of
	            students (N=479). It meets the psychometric requirements of
	            internal consistency, retest reliability, content, construct and
	            criterion validity. This questionnaire can be used to control the
	            quality of education, to do scientific research and

	            the field based or general higher education market. National or
	            international rankings put a lot of pressure on academic
	            leadership to fulfill the criteria of their methodologies.
	            Learning experience is becoming a more and more important
	            dimension of the motivation to study. In the contemporary context
	            of networking diversity, the process of generating learning
	            experience is becoming part of the institutional efforts related
	            to which creating an internal environment is connected to the
	            learning experience generating. The literature review proves a
	            higher interest on student engagement, on students’ and
	            graduates’ involvement in the institutional life, on development
	            a long-term relationship between university and graduates on one
	            hand and between university and industry on the other hand etc.
	            The common issue among all these subjects is the learning
	            experience that is provided to students through all the
	            activities in higher education institutions. What can be done or
	            develop in order to generate a great learning experience starts
	            from a correct, but flexible understanding of the concept. What
	            can be institutionally changed for the benefit of a higher
	            learning experience need a clear recognition of what more
	            experienced institutions have already achieved. The objectives of
	            the paper include: a) a clear understanding of the learning
	            experience concept; b) an overview of the current characteristics
	            of the learning experience providers; c) a start-up strategy for

	            education has allowed expanding access to education, breaking
	            geographical and economic barriers. This is achieved through the
	            availability of digital educational resources and the ability to

	            Significantly higher demand for such tools occurred during the {
	            COVID}-19 pandemic when distance learning was used by students in
	            their full-time studies. Current Learning Management Systems ({

	            ChatGPT} and effects on their academic writing, language
	            competency, and achievement. It significantly impacts their
	            productivity. However, not all Arab students utilize all the
	            benefits of the tool for some reasons including lack of
	            familiarity with the incipient {ChatGPT}. Based on the findings,
	            the study provides some important recommendation for utilizing
	            this chatbot in a way that increase their abilities in using
	            technology in their studies to save time and efforts as well as
	            familiarize them with sensitive issues of honesty and plagiarism.
	            The study may be useful to some other participants engaged with
	            academic writing in India and abroad.},

	abstract = {{EDM} and {LA} are two fields that study how to use facts to get
	            more academic learning and enhance the students’ entire
	            performance. Both areas are concerned with a broad range of
	            issues such as curriculum strategies, coaching, mental well-being
	            of students, learning motivation, and academic achievement. The {
	            COVID}-19 pandemic highly disrupted the higher education sector
	            and shifted the old, chalk-talk teaching-learning model to an
	            online learning format. This meant that the structure and nature
	            of teaching, learning, assessment, and feedback methodologies
	            also changes. With the empowerment in technology, timely and
	            effective feedback is provided by the teachers to achieve greater
	            learning. Through these studies, it is noted that negative
	            feedback discourages the effort and achievement of learners, so
	            it should be carefully crafted and delivered. In this work, a new
	            methodology is planned based on an improved {FCN} (fully
	            connected network). The key impartial of the proposed method is
	            to regulate the assessment of the quality of students in Higher
	            Education {HE}. The proposed methodology is composed of different
	            phases: The first phase is data acquisition, in which the data
	            are gathered from various sources for training and testing of the
	            proposed method. The second phase is data orientation, in which
	            the information is oriented in a specific file format. After that
	            , data are cleaned, and preprocessing methods are applied. In the
	            fourth phase, a machine learning-based model is developed to
	            predict student’s academic performance. The fully connected
	            neural network is enhanced with {LA} to better assess student
	            quality in higher education. The proposed work is evaluated with
	            the {OULAD} database, which was gathered from the students of
	            Open University. The proposed methodology has attained an
	            accuracy of 84\%, more significant than the conventional {ANN}
	            model accuracy rate. The proposed methodology’s Recall, F1-score,
	            and precision rates are 0.88, 0.91, and 0.93, respectively.},

	            making quick and accurate policies. Educational Data Mining ({EDM

	            the overall quality of education, etc. Besides, the relevance of
