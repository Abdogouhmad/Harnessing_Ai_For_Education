## Abstract

This research paper explores using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance learning
experiences in higher education. The study focuses on AI-driven tools such as Intelligent
Tutoring Systems, ChatBots, and Education Data Mining (EDM) to assess their impact on academic
performance and student engagement. Challenges such as AI bias and data privacy are also discussed,
providing a comprehensive view of the potential and limitations of AI in educational settings.
